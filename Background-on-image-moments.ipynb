    "# Background on image moments in scikit-image\n",
    "\n",
    "The moments of a shape are particular weighted averages (in statistics, \"moments\")\n",
    "of the pixel intensities. In physics they're the distribution of matter about\n",
    "a point or an axis etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are usually described as a function $f(x,y)$ which can just be read as\n",
    "_the value (or intensity) of the pixel in an image at position $(x,y)$_, so f is the 'image function'.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the image is binary (e.g. a binary blob), then we'd say the image function f takes\n",
    "values in [0,1].\n",
    "\n",
    "A moment of order $p + q$ is defined for a 2D continuous function on a region as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$M_{pq} = \\int x^p y^q f(x,y) dx dy$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we talk about _\"first order moments\"_ then we mean $M_{01}$, $M_{10}$, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$M_{01} = \\int y f(x,y) dx dy$$\n",
    "$$M_{10} = \\int x f(x,y) dx dy$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and by _\"second order moments\"_ we mean $M_{11}$, $M_{20}$, $M_{02}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have discrete pixels not a continuous function, in fact the integrals\n",
    "just become summations over x and y. So in other words: moments $M_{pq}$ counts\n",
    "the pixels over an image $f(x,y)$ and the $0^{th}$ moment is just the total count\n",
    "of pixels in an image, i.e. its area (it's usually called the area moment for binary\n",
    "images or otherwise the 'mass' of the image for grayscale etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Image moments are sensitive to position, but by subtracting the average x\n",
    "and y position in the above equation we can obtain a translation-invariant\n",
    "\"central moment\".\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Î¼_pq = \\int {(x-\\bar{x})}^p {(y-\\bar{y})}^q f(x,y) dx dy$$\n",

    "Meaning first order x or y moment divided by the area moment\n",
    "\n",
    "- $(\\bar{x},\\bar{y})$ is the centroid (a.k.a. centre of gravity)\n",
    "\n",
    "So far so simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second order moments $M_{20}$ and $M_{02}$ describe the \"distribution of mass\"\n",
    "of the image with respect to the coordinate axes. In mechanics they're the\n",
    "_moments of inertia_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another mechanical quality is the _radius of gyration_\n",
    "with respect to an axis, expressed as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sqrt{\\frac{M_{20}}{M_{00}}} \\hspace{10pt}and\\hspace{10pt} \\sqrt{\\frac{M_{02}}{M_{00}}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are others: scale invariant moments and rotation invariant moments\n",
    "(the latter are a.k.a. Hu moments)\n",
